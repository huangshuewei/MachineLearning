# Model Fitting

In this practice, I import a optimisation function from Scipy used to minimise the errors computed by CostFunction.
Cost functions are defined in Jupyter script which both are circle and ellipse cost functions.
Main optimal algorithm used in this practice is "Powell".


Using circle cost function to fit data will get unsatisfied result.
